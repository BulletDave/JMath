What is it?

This is a high level math API for Java which was designed to be easy and clear to use. It is possible to accomplish increadibly complex tasks using a single line of code. This library is specifically useful for game development, physics simulations and animation. For 2D game development, Vec2F is the most powerful tool at your disposal. It is by far the most advanced class in this library and supports tons of high level features. See the documentation for a full preview of the features offered.
